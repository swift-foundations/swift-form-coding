# swift-form-coding

[![CI](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-form-coding/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-form-coding/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
![Development Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active--development-blue.svg)

A convenience umbrella package that re-exports all form coding functionality for Swift.

## Overview

This package provides a single import for all form data encoding/decoding needs in Swift. It re-exports two independent packages:

- **[swift-url-form-coding](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-url-form-coding)** - URL form encoding/decoding (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`)
- **[swift-multipart-form-coding](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-multipart-form-coding)** - Multipart form data with file uploads (`multipart/form-data`)

## Installation

Add this package to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/coenttb/swift-form-coding", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

Then add the product to your target:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "FormCoding", package: "swift-form-coding")
    ]
)
```

## Supported Platforms

- macOS 14.0+
- iOS 17.0+
- tvOS 17.0+
- watchOS 10.0+
- Swift 6.1+

## Usage

```swift
import FormCoding

// URL Form Encoding
struct LoginForm: Codable {
    let username: String
    let password: String
}

let encoder = Form.Encoder()
let form = LoginForm(username: "john", password: "secret")
let formData = try encoder.encode(form)
// Result: "username=john&password=secret"

// Multipart File Upload
let imageUpload = Multipart.FileUpload(
    fieldName: "avatar",
    filename: "profile.jpg",
    fileType: .image(.jpeg),
    maxSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024
)
```

## When to Use Each Package

**Use URL Form Coding when:**
- Submitting simple form data without files
- Working with REST APIs that expect `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- You need PHP/Rails-style bracket notation for arrays

**Use Multipart Form Coding when:**
- Uploading files (images, documents, etc.)
- Mixing file uploads with form fields
- You need per-field content-type specification

## Individual Packages

If you only need one type of form coding, import the specific package instead:

```swift
// Just URL form encoding
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/coenttb/swift-url-form-coding", from: "0.1.0")
]

// Just multipart file uploads
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/coenttb/swift-multipart-form-coding", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

## URLRouting Integration

Both underlying packages support optional URLRouting integration via Swift Package Manager traits:

```swift
// In your Package.swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/coenttb/swift-form-coding",
        from: "0.1.0"
    )
]
```

When the `URLRouting` trait is enabled:
- `Form.Conversion<T>` and `Multipart.Conversion<T>` conform to `URLRouting.Conversion`
- URLRouting is re-exported for convenient access
- Convenience methods like `.form(_:)` and `.multipart(_:)` are available

## Architecture

This is a minimal umbrella package with no code of its own. It simply re-exports:
- `URLFormCoding` - URL-encoded form data support
- `MultipartFormCoding` - Multipart form data with file uploads
- `URLRouting` - Conditionally exported when URLRouting trait is enabled

The underlying packages are **completely independent** - they share no dependencies and can be used separately.

## Features

### URL Form Coding
